# üõ≥Ô∏è Ship Maintenance Dashboard

A frontend-only dashboard built with **React 19**, **Vite**, and **Material UI**. The whole app simulates full persistence using just `localStorage`‚Äîno backend needed. It's dark-mode by default.

Manage ships, components, and their maintenance jobs in a clean UI.


## Overview

This application supports three roles: **Admin**, **Inspector**, and **Engineer**.

They can:

- **Login** (hard-coded users for now)
- **Add/Edit Ships** (includes name, flag, status, etc.)
- **Manage Components** (assign to ships, track serials & maintenance logs)
- **Handle Jobs** (create/update/assign jobs with priorities)
- **View Calendar** (quick glance at scheduled maintenance)
- **See Notifications** (job status updates, etc.)
- **Check KPIs** (summary of what's happening in the fleet)

All data is stored in our browser via `localStorage`. No API. No database.
